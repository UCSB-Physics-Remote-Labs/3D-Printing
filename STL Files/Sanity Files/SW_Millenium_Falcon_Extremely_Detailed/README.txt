# Summary

I stumbled across this awesomely detailed Millenium Falcon surfing the net one night. 
I believe it was extracted from a game, as it was in some obscure file format. 
I've tried my best to convert it here in a couple of file formats.  But it is beyond my abillity to print it, so don't be surprised if you attempt to print it, you may loose detail due to the thin mesh walls. Still I'd love to see someone have a go at it, Good luck! Cheers Jace
