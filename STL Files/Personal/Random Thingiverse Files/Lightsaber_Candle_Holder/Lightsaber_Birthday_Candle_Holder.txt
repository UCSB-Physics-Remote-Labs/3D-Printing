Lightsaber Birthday Candle Holder
=================================

WARNING: I have no clue if your printing material is food safe!!!!  To be safe think about how you're using it and consider throwing out the part of the cake where the candle holder is.  I would recommend NOT licking the candle holders.

This is intended to be a candle holder for common birthday candles (US sizes).  Just print standard .2mm layer height, no infill, supports or rafts required.  Most of my candles shaved a little bit of the wax off when I shoved them in, a couple were looser.

Printing without support the "switch" part of the handle gets a little droop, I just filed that off.  You can also consider painting it if you want, though printing in gray works great.
